# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis and reporting notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends.  
It analyzes confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination progress across countries and over time.  
Using Python and real-world data, the project produces visualizations and key insights to better understand the pandemic’s impact globally.

## 🌍 Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across selected countries
- Visualize trends using charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a well-documented report

## 📊 Tools and Technologies

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
